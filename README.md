# Portfolio
It's a website about my Portfolio.There also have links in the navigation that is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport,like the page size becomes small the nav will become disapper.
It has six parts:
## ABOUT ME
my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
<p>There also have titled images of my applications. 
when your mouse on the image, it will become light color. When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.
